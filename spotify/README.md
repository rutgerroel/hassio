Play Spotify music on your Home Assistant device.

## About

**IMPORTANT**: _This add-on requires a Spotify Premium account!_

The Hass.io Spotify Connect add-on allows you to use your device running
Home Assistant to play your Spotify music. This add-on uses the Spotify
Connect protocol, which makes it show up a device that can be controlled
by all the official clients.

For example; Running Hass.io on a Raspberry Pi with this add-on installed
will allow you to play your Spotify music via the Pi. So all you'll have
to do is hook up your sound system to the Pi!
