Presence detection server for Happy Bubbles Bluetooth beacon-based
presence detection system.

## About

This add-on is a server that subscribes to MQTT topics that the "Happy Bubbles"
Bluetooth Beacon Presence Detectors publish to. It checks to see which of the
detectors found the strongest signal for a particular beacon, and then lets
you access that info either over an API, or a web interface.

It is designed to be used as a home-automation presence detection system.
If you install the detectors through-out a home and family members carry
beacons around the house, you can program your home automation hubs to
take certain actions depending on who entered or left certain rooms.

This add-on also publishes changes in location to a particular topic.
So you can program your hub to listen for these and make the desired changes
as they happen, to not have to keep polling it.
