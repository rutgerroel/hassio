Advanced IDE for Home Assistant, based on Cloud9 IDE

## Deprecation warning

**This add-on is in a deprecated state!**

This add-on is powered by the Cloud9 IDE project, which has been acquired by
Amazon in 2016. As of 17 October 2018, the open source development of the
Cloud9 Core has been halted.

It became harder to maintain and keep this add-on running. As the world
advances, but the C9 does not, so things become incompatible over time.

The point of no longer being able to upgrade parts of the add-on, has come.

Therefore this add-on will no longer receive any updates and is deprecated.

If you are running Hass.io on an amd64 based system, we would recommend changing
to the vscode add-on. For other architectures (e.g., Raspberry Pi), we expect
to release an alternative add-on.

## About

Cloud9 IDE is an online integrated development environment. It supports
hundreds of programming languages, including C, C++, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Python,
JavaScript with Node.js, and Go.

This add-on is a packaged version of the Cloud9 IDE, tuned for use with Home
Assistant. It is designed to allow you to configure and edit your Home Assistant
setup straight from the web interface using a useful, pretty and fullblown
editor.
